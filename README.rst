Verde - iGEM 2025

Testing (Need to use in Terminal/PowerShell):
=====

1. Initial Setup (only needs to be done once) 
  a. ``python3.11 -m venv verde-venv`` (MacOS/Linux) or ``py -3.11 -m venv verde-venv`` (Windows)
  b. ``source verde-venv/bin/activate`` (MacOS/Linux) or ``verde-venv\Scripts\activate`` (Windows)
    - If you get an error (especially in PowerShell), see `this page in the BeeWare tutorial`_.
  c. ``python3.11 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`` (MacOS/Linux) or ``py -3.11 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`` (Windows)
2. Running the app for your machine
  a. ``briefcase dev`` if you don't modify anything and are just looking at it as-is
  b. ``briefcase run -u`` (``-u`` is short for ``--update``) if you make changes to the code and want to see the updated version running
3. Distributing the app across platforms
  a. ``briefcase build`` to make a version for distribution. Note: Apple requires developers to register with them to get a signing certificate, so what you build on your local machine won't automatically work on others' Macs until you build this with a certificate (which takes a while to get).
